# Problem 4
# A palindromic number reads the same both ways. The largest palindrome made from the product of two 2-digit numbers is 9009 = 91 Ã— 99.
# 
# Find the largest palindrome made from the product of two 3-digit numbers.

#
# Our range numbers are between 100 and 999
# The most 'CPU' intense part is the 32b int to string which then needs to be scanned from both sides
# to test if its a palindrome.
#
# Some speed ups... we'll keep track of a 'max' found palindrome and skip the string conversion for anything
# less than that. We'll also do our loop backwares from 999 to 100 since that will more likely find the MaxV
# value earlier in the sequence.
