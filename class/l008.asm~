# First lets start with some values
# SmallVal = 15 which fits in the 'lower byte' of a 16 bit number
# Medval = 321  which takes up two bytes, but is 'small' in scale to the larger byte
# Large = 45321 which takes up a larger part of both lower and upper bytes.

#
# Test if one number is larger than another.
# For convience when its easy to think of the first number on the stack as being 'A'
# and the second number we compair it to, as bing 'B'
# 
# CMPI can be read, set flags as if you Subtraced A from B
#  321 - 15 = 306  so we would not expect any flags to be set.
